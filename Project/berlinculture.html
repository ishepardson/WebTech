    <h2>People</h2>
    <p>Berlin is a very diverse city filled with people from all around the world who speak different languages,
        practice different religions and think very differently. Berlin's open border policy adds to this by
        allowing refugees, who are mainly from the Middle East, to settle down and work towards living normal
        lives. After my stay in Berlin, I went home with so much more knowledge on different cultures from around
        the world, as well as a greater sense of open-mindedness.
    </p>
    <p>The people in Berlin are very stern and seem almost mad at first glance (especially with the harsh tone
        the German languauge gives off), but most of them are actually very nice and are generally more than 
        willing to lend a helping hand or chat for a bit. In many European countries, English is taught to
        children at a young age so many Berliners were either fluent or could get by in conversation, which made
        it easy for me as my German is "nicht ser gut".
    </p>
    <h2>Arts</h2>
    <p>
        What makes Berlin so unique is that there is a huge emphasis on self-expression, specifically through
        the various forms of art. The city itself provides stipends to aspiring artists so that they can purchase
        the essentials necessary for survival. Berlin's streets are flooded with different forms of street art,
        the citizens all express themselves differently by changing their appearances and many musicians have
        walked the streets and found inspiration from the thriving city including David Bowie and Iggy Pop (a 
        Bowie song that was recorded in Berlin is included on the home page).
    </p>
    <h2>Fun</h2>
    <p>
        A massive part of Berlin's culture is its thriving night life. All day and all night the city is alive
        as many people hang out at bars, grab some late night food and/or hit the numerous clubs that the city
        has to offer. On numerous occassions I was out with my friends until 7 or 8 in the morning the following
        day! With Berlin being such a big city, there is something to do at night for all different types of 
        people. Berlin is said to have the best night life in the World but since I haven't been to too many places
        in the world, I can't make that judgement call. It does, however, set the bar very high for any future 
        adventures I go on.
    </p>
    <p>
        Another large component of Berlin's culture, as well as much of Europe, is fussball (aka soccer).
        Berlin's professional team is BSC Hertha and even though the team itself isn't too strong, the fan base is
        very strong and passionate. Since Berlin is very diverse, only a small percentage of Berliners are fans
        of the city's team, but those who are fans pack the 1936 Olympic Stadium for most games to watch their
        team battle their opponents in the Bundesliga (German soccer leauge). With beers and bratwursts in their
        hands, the fans scream chants all throughout the match to show their support. It is truly a sight to see
        and it's honeslty much more impressive than going to a sporting event in America
