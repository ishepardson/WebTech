    <h1>My Proposal</h1>
    <p>My website will be about my semester abroad in Berlin. </p>
    <p>The objective of my project is to show all of the different aspects of Berlin, get people to be more interested in visiting Berlin and get people more interested in going abroad as well. I would also like to showcase the other countries that I visited to prove that travelling is fun.</p>
    <p>My target audience is Babson students. I'm am an Education Abroad Peer Advisor and I want all Babson students to go abroad and possibly even go abroad to Berlin.</p>
    <p>I plan to include pictures from my time abroad, personal testimonies from myself and others who went abroad, and pictures, diagrams and other statistics that prove how important it is to travel and learn about other cultures.</p>
