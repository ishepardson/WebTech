    <h1>All About Ian</h1>
<hr>
<h2 id= "about">About Me</h2>
<p><img src="images/Ian in Paris.jpg" width="200px"> I came to <a href="http://www.babson.edu/Pages/default.aspx">Babson College</a> because I was very interested in business and felt that Babson would give me the best education in regards to all things business. At first I was very interested in Finance but after taking a Finance course I realized that this was not the best field for me. Instead I will be pursuing a career in the field of Sales. I already have my full time offer to return as an Account Manager at a staffing firm close to Boston so that is where I will be after I graduate.</p>

<h2 id= "interests">My Interests</h2>
<p>During my free time I love hanging out with friends, working out, listening to <a href="https://www.spotify.com/us/">music</a>, going to the beach, skiing and watching shows, movies and sports. If I could afford it, I would go to as many concerts as humanly possible. Over Labor Day Weekend, I went to my first music festival in New York City and I loved it! My favorite genres are Rock, Hip Hop and Rap. My favorite artists are Queen, Pink Floyd, Led Zeppelin, Travis Scott and Frank Ocean.</p>
